# Hi there, I'm Fridrik861Atli 👋  

I'm a passionate and experienced software developer with a strong focus on building scalable, efficient, and maintainable systems. I thrive in solving complex problems and turning ideas into reality through clean, well-structured code. My expertise spans across multiple programming languages, frameworks, and tools, and I’m always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
Here are some of the technologies and tools I work with:  
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C#, Go  
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, SASS  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Django, Flask, Spring Boot, .NET Core

- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GitHub Actions, Terraform  
- **Tools**: Git, VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Postman, Jira  

## 🚀 My Approach to Development  
I believe in writing code that is not only functional but also clean, readable, and maintainable. I follow best practices like DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself), SOLID principles, and Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure high-quality software. Collaboration and communication are key to my workflow, and I enjoy working in agile environments where continuous improvement is encouraged.
